Username Enumeration:
	UserController.groovy: The signup() action should return only a single "invalid registration" message, and not give more information based on whether or not the user email exists
Weak Complexity
	UserController.groovy: Password length is checked, but 1. there should be no max password length and 2. it should validate a minimum level of complexity with the provided regex (commented out)
Templating XSS
	main/index.gsp: If the description needs formatting, use Markdown or something instead of just arbitrary HTML
Admin Console
	/dbconsole/: Accessible and unprotected database console. Grails doesn't neccesarily make it clear this exists!
